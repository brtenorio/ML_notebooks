# Anomaly_Detection

In this we will implement re-use the unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm but turn it into a simpler feed forward neural network for supervised classification.

We are training the neural network from healthy and broken samples.

The files necessary for taining are sampled from the lorenz attractor model.
